I want to cherry pick all the commits except for the first commit of  the main branch of git@github.com:xingfanxia/exif-photo-blog.git onto this project

I'll help you cherry-pick commits from that repository. Here's how to do it step by step:

1. First, add the remote repository and fetch its contents:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add photo-blog git@github.com:xingfanxia/exif-photo-blog.git

# Fetch the contents
git fetch photo-blog
```

2. Get the list of commits from the main branch in chronological order:

```bash
git log --oneline photo-blog/main --reverse
```

3. Once you have the list of commits, you can cherry-pick all commits except the first one. Assuming the first commit hash is `first_commit_hash`:

```bash
# Get all commits after the first commit
git rev-list first_commit_hash..photo-blog/main | tail -r | while read commit
do
    git cherry-pick $commit
done
```

Alternatively, if you want to do it manually, you can:

1. Copy all the commit hashes except the first one
2. Cherry-pick them in order:

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-1>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-2>
# ... and so on
```

If you encounter any merge conflicts during the cherry-pick process, you'll need to:
1. Resolve the conflicts
2. `git add` the resolved files
3. `git cherry-pick --continue`

Or if you want to abort the cherry-pick:
```bash
git cherry-
