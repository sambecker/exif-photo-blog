IMPORTANT: Do NOT use overused poetic words like "echoes", "whispers", "dreams", "soul", or similar clichés. Instead, draw inspiration from: contemporary art concepts, scientific phenomena, cultural references, unexpected juxtapositions, or specific sensory details unique to the scene. Each title should feel completely different from the last. Format: "English Title | 中文标题". Keep each title within 5-6 words. Make it memorable and original - if it sounds like a typical photo title, start over. Do not describe or identify any people.',
  'caption': 'As a photography curator, craft an artistic bilingual caption that captures the visual essence and photographic qualities of this scene. Focus on light, composition, mood, colors, or textures. Be creative with your language but stay focused on the photographic elements. Format: "English Caption | 中文说明". Keep each caption within 8 words but make them impactful. Do not describe or identify any people.',
  'title-and-caption': 'You are a creative bilingual poet and photography curator focused on originality. First, create a bold, unexpected title that avoids clichéd poetic words (no "echoes", "whispers", "dreams", "soul", etc.). Draw from contemporary art, science, cultural references, or unique sensory details. Then write a complementary caption that builds on the title\'s innovative theme. Format: Title: "English Title | 中文标题" Caption: "English Caption | 中文说明". Keep titles within 5-6 words and captions within 8 words. If either sounds generic or commonly used in photography, start over. Do not describe or identify any people.',
  'tags': `First, identify which ONE genre best describes this image from ONLY these options: portrait photography (人像摄影), landscape photography (风光摄影), animal photography (动物摄影), street photography (街拍摄影), event photography (活动摄影). Then generate exactly 10 tags in this strict format: first 5 tags in English (starting with the genre), followed by 5 tags in Chinese (starting with the genre's exact translation as provided). Focus on visual elements, mood, lighting, environment, and atmosphere. Do not describe or identify any people. Format your response as a simple comma-separated list. Example for a landscape photo: "landscape photography, mountains, sunlight, morning, misty, 风光摄影, 山脉, 阳光, 早晨, 薄雾"`,
  'description-small': 'Write a concise yet vivid description focusing on the key visual elements, mood, and atmosphere. Start directly with active, descriptive language. Focus on what makes this image unique or striking. Avoid generic phrases like "This image shows" or "This is a picture of".',
  'description': 'Write a balanced description that covers composition, lighting, mood, and subject matter. Include notable technical aspects like depth of field, color palette, or framing. Describe the overall visual impact and any interesting details that contribute to the image\'s story.',
  'description-large': 'Provide a comprehensive analysis of the image covering: 1) Technical aspects (composition, lighting, color, focus), 2) Subject matter and visual elements, 3) Mood and atmosphere, 4) Artistic choices and their impact, 5) Notable details and their contribution to the overall image. Use specific photography terminology where relevant.',
